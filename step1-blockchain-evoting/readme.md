# Let's fix a [broken] custom implementation of a Blockchain system for EVoting

A proof of concept for a use case of EVoting has been implemented, unfortunately as you will observe, some tests do not pass.
It's now up to you to fix those issues using what we learned regarding Blockchain characteristics.

## Instructions : Fix the following test on that order 

1. Passing test : TestBasicChain 
2. Failing test : BlockProofOfWorkGeneratorTest
3. Failing test : VotingServiceTest
4. Failing test : EVotingIntegrationTests

## Blockchain Key concepts explored in this PoC 
- [x] Linked Blocks using Hash 
- [x] Proof of Work algorithm 
- [ ] Consensus on P2P Network
